            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello ! I am Windokk, an aspiring game developer from France, eager to embark on my journey in the world of game development as a student and novice in the field.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="container">
                <p class="floater" style="text-align:justify; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 10px;">From a young age, my fascination with the captivating realm of video games ignited a passion that would eventually guide me toward a career in game development. My journey began at the age of 10 when I started creating my first games using Scratch, and that spark never faded. However, it was during the lockdown in 2020 that I stumbled upon professional game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine 4, and it was at that moment I realized my calling in the game industry. After over four years of honing my skills through the creation of small games, I recognized my desire to specialize in game design. This decision prompted me to delve into crafting game concepts and gameplay features, eventually leading to the birth of my main game concept, Cold Vendetta. Now, in 2023, at the age of 17, I am resolute in my ambition to attend one of the top game design schools in my opinion: Rubika, Isart Digital, or IIM next year.</p>
